What This Project Does
This project implements three interactive features using JavaScript:

Light/Dark Mode Toggle: A button that switches between light and dark themes, with persistence using localStorage.

Counter Game: A simple counter with increment, decrement, and reset buttons that changes color based on value.

Form Validation: A form with validation for name, email, and password fields with real-time feedback.

File Structure
index.html: Contains the structure of the webpage with semantic HTML5 elements.

style.css: Contains all styling with CSS custom properties for theming.

script.js: Contains all JavaScript functionality with clear comments.

Key Features
Theme System: Uses CSS variables for easy theming and localStorage for persistence.

Counter: Changes color based on value (green for positive, red for negative).

Form Validation: Provides real-time validation with helpful error messages.

Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

How to Use
Save all three files in the same folder.

Open index.html in a web browser.

Use the theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

Play with the counter buttons to change the value.

Try submitting the form with valid and invalid inputs to see the validation.

The code is simplified from the original but maintains all the core functionality while being more concise and easier to understand.
